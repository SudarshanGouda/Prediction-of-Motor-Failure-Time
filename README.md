# Prediction-of-Motor-Failure-Time


This dataset was generated for use on 'Prediction of Motor Failure Time Using An Artificial Neural Network' project (DOI: 10.3390/s19194342). A cooler fan with weights on its blades was used to generate vibrations. To this fan cooler was attached an accelerometer to collect the vibration data. With this data, motor failure time predictions were made, using an artificial neural networks. To generate three distinct vibration scenarios, the weights were distributed in three different ways: 1) 'red' - normal configuration: two weight pieces positioned on neighboring blades; 2) 'blue' - perpendicular configuration: two weight pieces positioned on blades forming a 90Â° angle; 3) 'green' - opposite configuration: two weight pieces positioned on opposite blades.

## There are 5 attributes in the dataset: wconfid,pctid,x,y and z.

wconfid: Weight Configuration ID (1 - 'red' - normal configuration; 2 - 'blue' - perpendicular configuration; 3 - 'green' - opposite configuration)
pctid: Cooler Fan RPM Speed Percentage ID (20 means 20%, and so on).
x: Accelerometer x value.
y: Accelerometer y value.
z: Accelerometer z value.
